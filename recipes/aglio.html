   <h1>Aglio e Olio</h1>

   <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. 
    The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. 
    If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. 
    My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Step 1</p>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. 
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Step 2</p>
            While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over
            medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive 
            oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. 
            Remove from heat. 
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Step 3</p>
            Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic,
            and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until 
            combined.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Step 4</p>
            Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
